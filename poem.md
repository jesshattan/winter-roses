#Winter Roses
*By John Greenleaf Whittier*  

My garden roses long ago  
Have perished from the leaf-strewn walks;  
Their pale, fair sisters smile no more  
Upon the sweet-brier stalks.  

Gone with the flower-time of my life,  
Spring's violets, summer's blooming pride,  
And Nature's winter and my own  
Stand, flowerless, side by side.  

So might I yesterday have sung;  
To-day, in bleak December's noon,  
Come sweetest fragrance, shapes, and hues,  
The rosy wealth of June!  

Bless the young bands that culled the gift,  
And bless the hearts that prompted it;  
If undeserved it comes, at least  
It seems not all unfit.  

Of old my Quaker ancestors  
Had gifts of forty stripes save one;  
To-day as many roses crown  
The gray head of their son.  

And with them, to my fancy's eye,  
The fresh-faced givers smiling come,  
And nine and thirty happy girls  
Make glad a lonely room.  

They bring the atmosphere of youth;  
The light and warmth of long ago  
Are in my heart, and on my cheek  
The airs of morning blow.  

O buds of girlhood, yet unblown,  
And fairer than the gift ye chose,  
For you may years like leaves unfold  
The heart of Sharon's rose
